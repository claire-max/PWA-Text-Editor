  ## Description
  For this app we will be building a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

  ## Installation
  1. Download the starter code from GitHub.
  2. Install dependencies using "npm install" 
  3. To invoke the app run:
  ``` npm start```
